Bankruptcy prediction analysis is a critical task in financial and risk management. It involves developing predictive models to determine whether a company is likely to go bankrupt based on various financial and operational factors. The ability to predict bankruptcy can help stakeholders, such as investors, creditors, and regulators, make informed decisions and mitigate financial risks.

In this analysis, we aim to explore a dataset containing financial and operational information of companies and build a predictive model for bankruptcy. The dataset includes key features such as assets, cash flow, debt, income, and various financial ratios. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we intend to develop a model that can effectively classify companies as "Healthy" or "Failed."

Throughout this document, we will walk through the steps of data preprocessing, feature selection, model building, and evaluation. We will also examine the performance of our model by generating classification reports and plotting ROC-AUC curves. The goal is to provide insights into the factors that contribute to bankruptcy prediction and to develop a reliable tool for assessing the financial health of companies.

This analysis is structured as follows: we start by loading the necessary libraries and defining functions, then proceed to load the dataset and preprocess it. We build and evaluate logistic regression models to predict bankruptcy, and we share the results of our analysis.

The insights gained from this analysis can be invaluable for making informed financial decisions, identifying potential risks, and enhancing the understanding of the factors that influence a company's financial stability.
